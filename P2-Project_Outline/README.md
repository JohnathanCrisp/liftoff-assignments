## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My Application will provide a point of sales system for users to sell products to customers. It's based around a restaurant environment but could be used for more. The entire reason I became interested in programming is throughout college I was a bartender to pay for bills and my schooling. There wasn't a single Point of sales system that I worked with that did everything we as employees needed it to do, nor did any of them run smoothly. I would like to tackle the task of implementing some of these functions in a basic point of sales system to further understand building a program from beginning to end.
